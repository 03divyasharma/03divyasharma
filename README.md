# 👋 Hi, I’m Divya Sharma

I’m an AI engineer and full-stack ML developer, currently interning at **Cognizant** after graduating with a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (May 2025).  

Recently, I built **InnerVision Studio**,  a production-ready, LLM-powered meditation platform that generates personalized guided audio sessions. 
It’s calm-tech, end-to-end engineered.

## 🧠 Recent Experience

🧪 **Intern – Cognizant Technology Solutions**  
Programmer Analyst (Summer 2025)

💡 **FeyNN Labs**  
ML intern (Clustering, PCA, EV market segmentation, forecasting model)

🔐 **iNeuron Intelligence**  
Built phishing URL detection SaaS with full CI/CD + deployment on Azure

🌍 **GirlScript Summer of Code**  
Open source contributor (10,000+ StackOverflow salaries analyzed via Python)

## Inner Vision Studio

🧱 **Infra Highlights**  
- **FastAPI + Celery + Redis** → Handles concurrency and queues
- **Cosmos DB** → Tracks sessions, meditation streaks, free limits
- **Azure Blob + SAS URLs** → Securely stores personalized audio
- **MLflow** → Logs user prompts, scripts, models, durations
- **LangChain RAG** → Personalizes meditations from knowledge documents
- **JWT Auth + CSRF + Rate Limiting** → Secures user access with cookies

## 💡 What Makes It Special

✨ Personalized meditations — infused with context, emotion, and affirmations  
✨ Fully asynchronous backend — built to scale quietly  
✨ Audio with ambient music — not just TTS, but **experience design**  
✨ Streaming + polling system — keeps users updated live  
✨ Built entirely solo — infra, backend, auth, product logic, and deployment
